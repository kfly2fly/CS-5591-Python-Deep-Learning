Write brief explanation here:

In this ICP we implemented 3 libraries. The numpy library is used to create ndimensional arrays. We used these numpy methods to manipulate np arrays. 

The pandas library was used to read in a csv file and perform column-wise manipulations. We filled in null values, aggregated columns, and filtered the columns. Finally we plotted 2 columns using numpy.

The MatPlotLib library was used to import and modify an image. The image was cropped using numpy slicing. The cropped image was saved. We then removed the background of the image using a numpy where statement and saved that figure.
