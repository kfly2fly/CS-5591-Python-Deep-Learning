Write brief explanation here:

In this ICP we created several classes to solve a payroll problem. These classes keep track of Employees, whether they be Full time or Part time.
The code demonstrates inheritence and default constructors. The program reads in a input file with commands, parses those commands, and creates a list
of employees. Finally it prints out metrics about the employees.

We also created a program that scrapes a wikipedia page for links. The program uses the beatiful soup library to skim through html tags. We check
for '<a>' tags and print the links.
