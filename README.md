# Python and Deep Learning

This repo is a place where source code and documentation can be added for CSEE-5590-001 Python Deep Learning. 



Every week we would have In Class Programming (ICP) assignments where we would apply things we have learned in class. This repo contains these ICP assignments.


Description of this course:
This course teaches students how Python (Part 1) and Deep Learning (Part 2) work as well as how to apply them to applications. Students will build applied programming skills using case studies from machine learning classification, Image classification, object detection and natural language processing. The programming language is Python.
Part 1 (Week 1 –8): Teaches programming skills useful to engineers and scientists. Learn how Python is used for machine learning applications. Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites for prior experience with computing tools required to perform projects. knowledge on R or MATLAB would be a good plus.
Part 2 (Week 9–16): learning programming for deep learning with Keras library. Learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build deep neural networks, optimization, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. Prerequisites: Prior knowledge and experience with Python.
