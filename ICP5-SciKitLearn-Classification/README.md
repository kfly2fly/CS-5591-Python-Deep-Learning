Write brief explanation here:
This ICP was an introduction into machine learning. We used classifiers predict data from 2 data sets: Titanic survivors and handwritten character. We imported the datasets for each data (test.csv and train.csv). We cleaned the data determined if the column was a feature we wanted to train and test the model on. We visualized a couple correlations on datasets. Then we fit and predicted using the methods learned in lecture and finally we reported prediction accuracies and confusion matrix for all the algorithms.
Algorithms used: SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN
