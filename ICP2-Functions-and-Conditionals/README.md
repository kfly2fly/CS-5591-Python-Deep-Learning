Write brief explanation here: We implemented 2 solutions to change inches to cm. The first used a loop to iterate over an input values. The second used list comprehension. In the second problem, we used functions and string concatenation/manipulation to return the full name of a student. In the final problem, we used a dictionary to keep track of the word count of a file. The key was the word and the value was the word count.
