# Write brief explanation here:
In this ICP, we examined a housing and credit card information data set with the goal of doing regression and clustering. On the housing dataset, we explored and preproccessed the data by removing outliers. After that we fit a regression line with 2 variables using a Linear Regression object. Next we fit a Linear Regression object with the top 5 most correlated objects and also fit a Linear Regression object using PCA transformed data. Finally we compared these to find that the PCA regression line performed slightly better than the top 5 attributes because the PCA data was able to explain more of the variance in the data. We clustered the data three different ways:
1.) with just fitting and predicting the dataset cluster without doing anything to the data besides cleaning it of null values.
2.) Scaling the data then fitting and predicting
3.) taking the scaled data and applying PCA on it
for each case, we calculated the silhouette score and saw that the first method yielded the highest silhouette score and the 3rd on yielded the lowest.
